# GeoVisionAI: AI-Driven Geospatial Storytelling with Liquid Galaxy (Web based Interface)

**GeoVisionAI** is an AI-powered geospatial storytelling system that converts spoken or typed queries into immersive, map-based narratives using Google Gemini, OpenCage, and Liquid Galaxy. Built as part of **Google Summer of Code 2025** under the **Liquid Galaxy Project** organization.

## Features

* **Voice & Text Interface**: Ask questions via voice or typing.
* **Gemini AI Integration**: Generates intelligent, story-like responses from user queries.
* **AI Narration**: Narrates the generated story using text-to-speech for an immersive experience.
* **Location Identification**: Detects and geocodes relevant global locations using OpenCage.
* **Liquid Galaxy Support**: Visualizes locations via Fly-To animations and Balloon placemarks.
* **Ambient Sounds**: Plays environmental audio relevant to the story using Freesound.
* **Orbit Control**: Start or stop orbiting motion on Liquid Galaxy screens.
* **Responsive Design**: Adaptive interface for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

## Try Sample Queries
(For the queries that you suspect return of long responses, just add after the query "Answer in 1-2 lines" or else you may exhaust your per day token limit for Gemini)
* "What are the effects of rising sea levels on Maldives?"
* "How has Mumbai's coastline evolved in 50 years?"
* "What is the capital of India?"
* "What is the capital of France?"
* "Take me to Tokyo" / "Show me the Mount Everest"

## Outputs You See
*  FlyTo geolocation in Google Earth (Liquid Galaxy)
*  Balloon Placemark with Gemini-generated story
*  AI narration of the story (text-to-speech)
*  Audio related to environment (e.g., waves, forest, city)
